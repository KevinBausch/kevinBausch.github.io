        <div class="introduction">
          <p>We saw previously that HTML is essential for any website, it represents the starting point to create any website. Basically, you can build a structure for a web and add some text as content same as a word document. Meanwhile, CSS is in charge to make all elements in HTML look nice and responsive, it is like a painting over a white canvas. Finally, at this stage, we have Javascript to add functionality to any website allowing the users to interact with the website and its features and content.</p> 
          <p>A better way to see and understand HTML, CSS and JS are by imagining that you want to go from point A to point B riding a horse. The horse will represent HTML, it can take you where you want but it will not be ideal. However, if you add some CSS to this horse, it will become a great mountain bike, it will look nice and you will have more control and comfort along your ride. Now imagine that you add some javascript to your mountain bike, it will become a motorbike, this time you will have more power, you will be able to go faster and overall you will enjoy the experience.</p><br>

          <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
          <p>Control flow is the order in which the computer will execute statements in a script to incorporate interactivity.  A script is basically a set of instructions that are executed when a program is running. A good way to see this is by imagining that we are cooking following a chef recipe, we may shortcut some steps or alter the other of the instructions but we will get a better outcome if the recipe is followed step by step.</p>

          <p>Loops are basically interaction statements that will run until some conditions are met and it is an easy way to repeat intentionally something we want to do. Imagine that you are playing one of those gambling games where you deposit a coin and play some commands, you are playing and playing until you win, well that is a loop.</p>

          <h3>What is DOM?</h3>
          <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform programming interface that allows users to manipulate, create or remove elements from HTML and XML documents and it is represented as a tree of objects. it is a way to represent web pages in a hierarchical structure which make it easy for users to interact with them.</p>

        <div class="padding">
          <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
          <p>In Javascript, an array is a representation of a single variable that stores different information of multiple elements of the same type. On the other hand, loops are used for repetitive tasks where conditions must be met to get results.</p>
          
        </div>

        <div class="padding">
          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>A function is a set of statements that form an instruction to get a specific outcome and it is executed when is it is called. A function is a block of code that after receiving some specific input it will provide an outcome.</p>
