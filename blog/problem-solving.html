      <h1>Problem solving</h1>
      <H3>Got blocked on a simple problem</H3>
      <p class="identity">
        I got  stuck in many simple problems many times and most of them were because of small details I could not notice like capital letter instead of small letters. It is just my emotions playing against me since I am trying to go as fast as possible but this is not always right. In the end, you start noticing this kind of errors when you slow down and try to explain to yourself line by line of the code. The problem was that durint Jsintro mys functions did not pass the test and I saw that my wording was not correct acording to the instructions even when the results of the function were correct. I felt so frustrated because i did not understand why this was happening and my learning is that I have to be careful with the instructions to avoid overcomplicating my life.
      </p>
     <H3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</H3>
     <p class="identity">
      I was working on the scores exercises during JS Kata and then I got stuck on exercise number 9 or 10  for several minutes so I decided to imagine I did not learn anything before and I tried to find some theory about this topic instead of keep trying  to resolve the problem with the same strategy I was. In the end I got enlighted after refreshing my knowledge and I could resolve the exercise faster than ever. I realised that at this stage my knowledge is still fragile and requires more practice to be more confident. After resolving the exercise I felt really happy, it was a huge achievement for me at the moment.

      <h2>Problem solving techniques</h2>
      <p class="identity">
        
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Pseudocode</strong></li>
            <p class="identity"> 
              For me, this is the best technique, it helps to understand the problem since we have to divide it in small pieces, it is a good way to plan any code, I like this one I will be using it for medium or complex problems.
            </p>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Trying something</strong></li>
            <p class="identity"> 
            I use this technique the whole time, during my learning process this one is my best friend. I  just have to try different ways  to resolve something until I get it.
           </p>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></li>
            <p class="identity"> 
            This technique is one of the best and my second favorite,  trying to explain a code line by line it is  agreat way to notice errores and keep learning. 
           </p>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Reading error messages</strong></li>
           <p class="identity"> 
            I think this is one of the most basic techniques, you always have to check what is th error message but from my personal view it is only helpful combined with other techniques.
            </p>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Console.logging</strong></li>
           <p class="identity"> 
            I use this one the whole timeand I will keep console.logging anycode, it makes me feel confident when I see the expected results.
            </p>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Googling</strong></li>
            <p class="identity"> 
            Google is my best friend, without google and youtube life would be more difficult, sometimes we will not find the exact answers for our questions but there is a bunch of information out there that will end up helping us a lot.
            </p>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></li>
            <p class="identity"> 
            This is not one of my favorites since itis more satisfactory resolve problems by myself and sometimes people cannot help you straight away. Howeevr, if the above techniques fail for any reason this is the one that can save the day.
            </p>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></li>
            <p class="identity"> 
            Same as Asking my peers for help, I think this technique will be  used as the last option after trying all other techniques or maybe when I require some specific and technical information.
           </p>
          <li class="identity"><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></li>
            <p class="identity"> 
            I think this technique applies for  life in general as well. I like the reflection process to improve but this must go with practice, it is an excellent way to consolidate new learning.
