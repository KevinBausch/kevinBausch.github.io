            <h3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people </h3>
            <p class="identity">Knowing the principles of neuroplasticity allow us to understand the biological processes of our  brain and  how it works under different stimuli. This can provide us a powerful tool to improve our learning and memory.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="identity">Use it or lose it: our  brain will delete  the information or   knowledge (neuronal conecctions) that are not used, so it is better to practice everything we learn to make the conections stronger everytime. </li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Use it and improve it: the more we use the new knowledge the better and stronger the conections will become in our brain, so practice is the key.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Specificity: The connection can become stronger when we do the same thing in different ways, the learning  will be solid.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Repetition matters: The more time we spend practicing and repeating something the better will be our performance.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Intensity: challenges allow learning</li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Time: There is a specific moments when we canc reate  better connections, some people are morning persons and others night persons.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Saliences: Our emotions are key to create connections, the more motivated we are the easier to learn something will be.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Age: our brains are flexible independent of our age but is better to be mentally active.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Transference: we can use the same way of learning to different topics</li>
                <br>
                <li class="identity">Interference: Our brain just keep learning the whole time without filtering good or bad habits, that is why it is important  to have good learning routines sincethe beginning.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
            <p class="identity">From a  personal point of  view I think I have been practising  some of them without knowing them  in depth but now that I have a better  understanding of these neuroplasticity principles I  think I have to keep my motivation up with small challenges, this will keep me repeating and practicing activities until the learning is solid and the neuronal connections are strong. I have notice that I really need to follow structures and it is better for me to create a schedule or a daily learning plan to follow step by step to avoid creating bad habits.</p>

            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p class="identity"></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="identity">Set meaningful goal</li>
                <li class="identity">Micro-steps</li>
                <li class="identity">Adopt a growth mindset</li>
                <li class="identity">Find clarity</li>
                <li class="identity">Practice mindfulness</li>
                <li class="identity">Select circle of influence</li>
                <li class="identity">Exercise routine</li>

            <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
                <p class="identity"> What it is and why it is relevant?</p>
                <p class="identity">It is important because it helps us to overcome difficult situations at the moment of learning allowing us to develop new skills. It opens new learning possibilities changing our perception.</p><br>

                <p class="identity">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p>
                <p class="identity">Yes, I have noticed how  important is to understand the principles of neuroplasticity overall about motivation and interference. Now  I think I am ore aware to stop bad learning habits.</p><br>

                <p class="identity">How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
                <p class="identity">I will adopt a view where challenges are a gift, an opportunity to evolve and develop new skills. I understand that learning is a long process and requires practice, motivation and determination to succeed.</p><br>

                <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
                <p class="identity"> How these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy?</p>
                <p class="identity">I think my  mind has changed after reading and understanding concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindset. In the past I was overwhelmed by challenges or difficult situations, of course not always but very often, and now I realised that this kind of situations are a huge opportunity to develop new skills and the new skills will allow me to keep along this learning journey because we have to be constantly learning. My focus now will be to ensure I am learning and this new knowledge is strong in my mind, I think I will stop thinking about the deadlines of any taks and I will use my motivation to practice and repeat as much as i can until I can master new skills. Also I will keep an eye on my bad habits which may be affecting my learning path.
