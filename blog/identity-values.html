            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
            <p class="identity">I did not have ethical decisions to make since I always based my decisions on my thoughts or personal values and not on my emotions. Of course, I have been in situations where you could feel trapped in a dilemma because you need to help a friend or family but if you take out your feeling or emotions from the equation then every situation will become easier to resolve. <br>Also if your social circle share the same values as you then you speak the same code there is no reason to be trapped in a dilemma where you have to choose between two options because there is only one, the correct one. I think the idea is to make decisions that will make you feel proud of yourself. That is why I consider respect, honour and loyalty as my values.</p>

            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p class="identity">I think my culture influenced my personal values and identity since it was clear for me to see the contrast between what is correct and what is not correct. In Peru, where I come from you can see, from my personal perspective, a huge contrast in terms of values as a society.
            <br>In some places, you will find friendly and honest people eager to help others and cause a positive impact in the world but at the same time, you can see people who are only focused on themselves that they can be so inconsiderate with other human beings in their everyday actions.
            I think that being able to see different peopleâ€™s behaviour shape my values and made me clear the kind of human being I want to be.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>
            <p class="identity">Strenghts:</p>
                <ul class="identity">
                    <li class="identity">I have a good supportive environment, this includes friends, family and my partner. They provide emotional support when is required and contacts who can be helpful in the future to keep learning, find a job or create a network.</li><br>
                    <li class="identity">I am confident that this is the path I want to follow which allows me to be motivated and keep working on this field until I am successful.</li><br>
                    <li class="identity">I am hardworking and creative.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p class="identity">Limitations:</p>
                <ul class="identity">
                    
                    <li class="identity">I can be stubborn and spend a lot of time trying to find the answer by myself that I forget sometimes is just better to ask for help.</li>
                    
                </ul>


            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p class="identity">I definitely believe that being curious, creative and hardworking will help me a lot in my learning journey. I am pretty sure difficult and stressful times are coming soon butt being creative and hardworking will make those times more enjoyable. </p>
