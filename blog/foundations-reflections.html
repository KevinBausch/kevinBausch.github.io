              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </h4>
            <p class="identity">
              I  learnt that controlling the  way we react  under our emotions can make the difference  during  a learning process. Learning to code is a difficult process full of frustrations but some of them could be use as motivation and some others are important to reflect what we are doing good or bad. Our emotions during difficult situations are an opportunity to improve who we are and ensure we are acquiring more skills than before.
            </p>
           
            
            
            <h4 class="identity">
              What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </h4>
            <p class="identity">
              I think they are really important not only during this process to learn how to code but in life in general. Learning to code, from my point of view is a difficult task, at least in the beginning, and this process requires the learner to be in balance. It is not possible to be in balance if you do not have a clear idea of yourself, others and the context.
            </p>

            
            <h4 class="identity">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?

            </h4>
            
            <p class="identity">
              What surprised me more was the impact of emotional intellenge, I was always aware of its importance but since I am conscious that  EI is part of this boot camp I started paying more attention and as a result I am noticing that I developing more control over my reactions and this is causing a positive impact in my life even out of coding time.
            </p>
            
            
                <h4 class="identity"> 
                  What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?

                </h4>
                <p class="identity">I would say that neuroplasticity is the most challenging aspect of core learning, of course it is not enough with reading and understanding some concepts. The biggest challenge comes when we want to apply small steps to change big and old routines.
                </p>

                <h4 class="identity">
                  Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?

              </h4>
                <p class="identity">Because it is important to be focused on people, everybody can learn new skills by their own but improve who we are, the way we act, requires a third party  to push and point a path to follow from a  different perspective  of view which sometimes we just do not notice. I have learnt a lot about my self during the first weeks and for me tis is invaluable.</p>

                <h4 class="identity">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
                </h4>

                <p class="identity">To be honest when I started studying core aspects I felt like it was a waste of time. However, with the past of the time I noticed that being in front of my computer learning and researching was not enough, we really need to bring the best of us during each session. I had to face a lot of changes of my mood because my emotions were affected during this process of learning and  without the core aspects I think at this stage I would have quit  but It has been the opposite, I am applying my new learning and I can see results.
