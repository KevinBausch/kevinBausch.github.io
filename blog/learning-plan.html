            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p class="identity">My long term goal is to become a Software Developer to find a job that allows me more flexibility to travel and enjoy this short life while working. Also, I want to use my future skills and experience to develop my own business ideas. I know this will take a while but I am keen to enjoy the journey.</p>

            <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <p class="identity">I consider my strengths are the below:</p>
                <ul class="identity">
                    <li class="identity">I am consistent, this helps me to keep working and do not give up.</li>
                    <li class="identity">I am curious and this is important to understand the reason for things and always keep learning.</li>
                    <li class="identity">I am creative and I think this is the most important of my strengths to learn. There are times where I use my creativity to find different ways to resolve a problem which ends up in learning.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="identity">My limitations are:</p>
                <ul class="identity">
                    <li class="identity">Sometimes I am a bit stubborn and this takes me to spend a lot of time focusing on one thing trying to find the answer when is better to ask for help after some point and be more efficient</li>
                    
                </ul>


            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p class="identity">I would like to learn how to be more efficient when learning new topics</p>
            
            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
            <p class="identity">When I am stuck I will try to find the answer by my self spending between 15-30 minutes, otherwise, I will ask for help from my facilitator or the Dev community.</p>

            <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p class="identity"> I am expecting them to be supportive when required and provide feedback if possible every week, this is important for me because sometimes we do not see what others can see and their opinion can create a huge positive impact on our activities.  </p>

            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
            <p class="identity">I am happy to have a supportive environment during the time of the Bootcamp and I do not have any other commitments that can stop me or disturb my learning during this intense process. My only commitment is to attend the Bootcamp.</p>
