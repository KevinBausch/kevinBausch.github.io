            <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p class="identity">
                My long term goal is to build my own projects, make real some ideas I have in mind. However, first I want to gain working experience after Bootcamp. I definitely will be looking for an internship or a job as a web developer after the Bootcamp and I would like to work in a small company where I can be exposed to many different situations that will force me to keep learning in an intensive way.
            </p>

            <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p class="identity">
                My motivation and positive attitude are my biggest strengths together with being curious and creative. I think my strengths will let me succeed during the Bootcamp

            </p>
               

            <p class="identity">
                I did not notice this before but I consider that a  limitation  I am facing is the feeling I have when  I have a lot of material to cover and the time is running out. It is a bit of desperation and this impacts in a negative way my performance. I feel in a rush all the time but I have to slow down, I think is better to think slow to go faster and I have to do this.

            </p>
                


            <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            <p class="identity">
                I think the biggest challenge during the next 9 weeks will be to stay on top of the material, it is not about just doing what we are suggested to do but most importantly it is about consolidating the new skills. Since this is an intense course, from my point of view it is a bit difficult to consolidate the new learning in a short period of time but this is what makes it interesting. Anyway, I will try to do my best but for some reason, I have the feeling that I would like to have more hours during the day.

            </p>
            
            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p class="identity">
                I never had problems working in groups but since the pace of the Bootcamp is intense I would like to develop communications and teamwork skills to face in a more efficient way the intensity of Bootcamp.
            </p>

            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p class="identity"> 
                I want to focus on keeping my mind calm and relaxed, this is the key for me to acquire new knowledge, I do not like going fast before I have completely understood a specific topic
            </p>

            <h3>Foundations</h3>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p class="identity">My long term goal is to become a Software Developer to find a job that allows me more flexibility to travel and enjoy this short life while working. Also, I want to use my future skills and experience to develop my own business ideas. I know this will take a while but I am keen to enjoy the journey.</p>

            <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <p class="identity">I consider my strengths are the below:</p>
                <ul class="identity">
                    <li class="identity">I am consistent, this helps me to keep working and do not give up.</li>
                    <li class="identity">I am curious and this is important to understand the reason for things and always keep learning.</li>
                    <li class="identity">I am creative and I think this is the most important of my strengths to learn. There are times where I use my creativity to find different ways to resolve a problem which ends up in learning.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="identity">My limitations are:</p>
                <ul class="identity">
                    <li class="identity">Sometimes I am a bit stubborn and this takes me to spend a lot of time focusing on one thing trying to find the answer when is better to ask for help after some point and be more efficient</li>
                    
                </ul>


            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p class="identity">I would like to learn how to be more efficient when learning new topics</p>
            
            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
            <p class="identity">When I am stuck I will try to find the answer by my self spending between 15-30 minutes, otherwise, I will ask for help from my facilitator or the Dev community.</p>

            <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p class="identity"> I am expecting them to be supportive when required and provide feedback if possible every week, this is important for me because sometimes we do not see what others can see and their opinion can create a huge positive impact on our activities.  </p>

            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
            <p class="identity">I am happy to have a supportive environment during the time of the Bootcamp and I do not have any other commitments that can stop me or disturb my learning during this intense process. My only commitment is to attend the Bootcamp.</p>
